Iterate through commands in an array
if command is L and D = T set D = L 
                    D = L set D = B 
                    D = B set D = R 
                    else set D = T

if command is R and D = T set D = R 
                    D = R set D = B 
                    D = B set D = L 
                    else set D = T

if command is F then 
                move to the next character in the array and    
                add the number to distance
